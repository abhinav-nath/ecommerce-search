# Named-Entity Recognition (NER)

Named-Entity Recognition (NER) or Entity Extraction, scans search queries to identify and classify words or phrases into predefined categories, such as names of people, brands, products, locations, styles, colors, quantities, monetary values, percentages, and many other features.
These predefined categories (mostly) represent real-world objects and are described by proper nouns.
